This is a Bash script to collect images from the Nasa Earthview satellites (https://worldview.earthdata.nasa.gov) 

It's focussed on the Lake Eyre drainage basin in this script, but gathering images of another location is a simple task.

It processes the images to put include a date stamp and produce a list of the images that have less than 40 percent cloud cover

For a sample of the output, see the video "Lake Eyre Timelapse Animation - Five years in one minute" at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvYXzUOsnlI
